# Find the bug

I've written some code to help me count lines but it doesn't seem to work. Every time I call the incrementer function I receive 

Can you help me find the error?

## File Structure

```
--> src
    |-> index.js - The code
    |-> index.spec.js - The test cases it needs to pass
```

## Running the tests

The tests should be visible on your display. They will automatically run as you save the file.

## Acceptance

Without modifying the tests they should all pass. Once you've found the issue please explain the change or changes you made to the program.
